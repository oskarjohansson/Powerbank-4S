# Powerbank 4S
A powerbank to primarily use with MDP-XP Modular Power Supply. It can be found [here](https://www.welectron.com/Miniware-MDP-XP-Modular-Power-Supply). 

## Background 
One of the problems when using li-ion batteries is the charging, without a proper charger the cells wil be damages and probably start a fire. To remove these problems one solution would be a BMS with USB-C as a charging and discharging port. This doesn't exist yet, so someone has to make it. 

## Specification
- 4S high power Li-ion 
- Charge with USB-C
- Discharge with USB-C/DC jack

## Hardware core

> The following parts will be used as the main part of the project

* Charge controller from TI - [BQ25723RSNR](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq25723.pdf?ts=1637573546478&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Feu.mouser.com%252F)
* USB-C PD Interface from onsemi - [FUSB302B01MPX](https://www.mouser.se/datasheet/2/308/1/FUSB302B_D-2314121.pdf)
* MCU from Microchip - [ATSAMD21G18A](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/SAM-D21DA1-Family-Data-Sheet-DS40001882G.pdf)
