# Powerbank 4S
A powerbank to primarily use with MDP-XP Modular Power Supply. It can be found [here](https://www.welectron.com/Miniware-MDP-XP-Modular-Power-Supply). 

## Background 
One of the problems when using li-ion batteries is the charging, without a proper charger the cells wil be damages and probably start a fire. To remove these problems one solution would be a BMS with USB-C as a charging and discharging port. This doesn't exist yet, so someone has to make it. I also want to use it with both the powersupply and to charge my laptop using USB-C. 

## Specification
- 4S high power Li-ion 
- Charge with USB-C
- Discharge with USB-C

### Extra 
- Able to charge computer from powerbank
- An extra USB-A port for charging phones without USB-C.
